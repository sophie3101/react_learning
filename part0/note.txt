- Instead of using push to add new item to array, React prefers to use concat:
	const t = [1, 2, 3]
	t.concat(5)
it will then create new array in which content of old array and new item is added
- map: t.map( value => value * 2)
- destructuring: 
	[a, b] = [ 10,20]
	[a, b, ...rest] = [10,20, 30 ,40,50]
	then rest is [30, 40, 50]

However, a global installation is not necessary. From the root directory of your app, we can run the json-server using the command npx:

npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
